The purpose of a MaterialApp widget is to provide a common theme setting based on 
Material design and configures the root navigator for all of its children widgets.

Never use two, atleast not one in other.

When we use .pushNamed() it keeps the other screen in stack thus enabling to get back to the previous state.
It can come in handy when navigating betweent he pages after loggin in but donot use it while logging in.
